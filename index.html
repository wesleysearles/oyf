            <p>We would like to retract the earlier post about us not getting on Skappleton an the petition.<br /><br />We got hold of the guy from STD we mentioned and He happens to be a nice chap heres what he had to say<br /><br />"<br />I did some more investigation. It's hard to say since the people that were there last year are no longer there. Ultimately it comes down to a note left that references a broken mic and a drum thrown against a wall.<br />Best I can tell you is that ever since the toasters singer threw a mic at the ground many years back, that was taken very seriously as it cost the university $. Not that you guys cost anyone money, but that may have raised a flag. The thrown snare may have just red flagged the possibility for destruction to Lawrence property. I think they are looking for band to come in play with no potentially destructive antics. I know it's not your MO, so may not be a good fit in the end anyway. I think you guys need a place where you can really be yourselves.<br />Kenny "<br /><br />So we broke a mic accidentally, and Wes threw a drum. People got scared and don't want us back<br /><br /><br /><br />

            <p>The line up for this years Skappleton was recently posted on <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=59314097&blogID=358458652">their Myspace</a>we are not on it.<br /><br />We played last year and had a great reception we were invited back but unfortunately things are under new management. The new Management being from the band STD who has a personal vendetta against us.<br /><br />So we setup a <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/skasucks/petition.html">petition</a> in hopes of stirring some gossip if nothing else. be sure to check it out and sign up <br /><br />
